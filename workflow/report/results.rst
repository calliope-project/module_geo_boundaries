This module creates a dataset with polygonal data of country boundaries and marine exclusive economic zones (EEZ).
Several datasources are possible: `GADM <https://gadm.org/>`_, `Overture Maps <https://overturemaps.org/>`_ or `NUTS <https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/statistical-units/territorial-units-statistics>`_.

If configured, an empty buffer is calculated between all regions to avoid overlaps between them.
